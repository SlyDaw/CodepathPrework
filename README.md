## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Snapchat
    - Messages are deleted after 24 hours
    - Can see where friends are on map

- Chess.com
    - Can play chess against friends
    - can learn tactics and do puzzles

- Youtube Music
    - Can create playlists and share with friends
    - can download youtube videos to phone
 
An app idea could be a study buddy app. The app would match 2 indiviudals who are studying for the same subject together so they can study for an upcoming exam or other things of the nature. They could either voice chat or video call and will have functionality such as sharing screen and drawing on a white board. This app would be free and would save people money as they wouldn't have to pay for a tutor.

## Notes

I was initially having trouble with getting `Hello World` to show up before following the instructions. Then I figured out that some of the IDE elements were hidden so I'm glad I continued with reading the instructions.
